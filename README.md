## 1. Introduction

This project is designed to do everything you never knew you needed. It slices, it dices, it makes julienne fries, and it can even predict the weather (if you live in a very small, windowless room). Our codebase is written in a proprietary blend of Python, JavaScript, and the tears of frustrated developers.

## 2. Installation

To install, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the internet.
2. Unzip the universe.
3. Clone this repository using telepathy or, if unavailable, `git clone`.
4. Run `install.sh` with administrator privileges, root access, and a note from your mom.
5. Wait for the installation to finish. This may take anywhere from 3 seconds to the heat death of the universe.

## 3. Usage

To use this project, simply think about what you want it to do, and it probably won't do it. For best results, run the following command:

```
run_the_thing --with-extra-cheese --no-onions
```

If you see a message that says "Everything is broken," congratulations! You have successfully run the program.

## 4. Advanced Usage

For advanced users, try editing the `config.yaml` file and changing every value to `42`. This unlocks the secret mode, which does absolutely nothing, but in a much more complicated way.

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please try the following steps:

- Turn your computer off and on again.
- Sacrifice a rubber chicken to the debugging gods.
- Consult the README file (you're already here, so that's a good start).
- Ask a question on Stack Overflow and wait for someone to tell you to read the documentation.
- Give up and go outside.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this project work on Windows?**
A: Maybe.

**Q: Is there a GUI?**
A: Yes, but it's invisible.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Only if you can solve the riddle of the Sphinx.

## 7. Unfrequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?**
A: African or European?

**Q: If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does this project still crash?**
A: Absolutely.
