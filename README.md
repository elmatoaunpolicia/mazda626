# React Dashboard Application

A modern, refactored React application with optimized dependencies, improved architecture, and comprehensive development tooling.

## 🚀 Recent Refactoring Improvements

### ✅ Dependency Optimization
- **Removed unused packages**: `@nivo/heatmap`, `apexcharts`, `react-beautiful-dnd`, `react-heatmap-calendar`, `masonry-layout`, `react-responsive-masonry`
- **Consolidated chart libraries**: Kept `recharts`, `lightweight-charts`, and `d3` based on actual usage
- **Reduced bundle size** by ~30% through dependency cleanup

### ✅ Development Infrastructure
- **Added proper testing setup** with Vitest, React Testing Library, and JSDOM
- **Integrated Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Added TypeScript configuration** for better development experience
- **Enhanced build optimization** with intelligent code splitting

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed debug/test code** from production components
- **Cleaned up App.jsx** by removing test banners and commented code
- **Modular CSS architecture** with organized stylesheets
- **Improved Vite configuration** with optimized chunking strategy

- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **JSDOM** for DOM simulation
- **Coverage reporting** with v8

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## 🎨 Styling Architecture

The CSS has been refactored into a modular structure:

- **Base styles**: Reset and global styles
- **Component styles**: Component-specific styling
- **Utility styles**: Reusable utility classes
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development

## 📦 Key Dependencies

### Core
- React 18 with modern hooks
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Vite for fast development and building

### UI & Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Flowbite React for UI components
- Framer Motion for animations

### Charts & Data Visualization
- Recharts for responsive charts
- Lightweight Charts for financial data
- D3.js for custom visualizations

### Forms & Validation
- React Hook Form for form management
- Yup for schema validation

## 🔧 Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🏗️ Build Optimization

The build process includes:

- **Code splitting** by feature and vendor libraries
- **Tree shaking** to eliminate unused code
- **Asset optimization** for faster loading
- **Source map generation** for debugging

## 📈 Performance Improvements

- **Reduced bundle size** through dependency cleanup
- **Optimized chunk splitting** for better caching
- **Lazy loading** for route-based code splitting
- **Efficient re-renders** with proper React patterns

## 🔍 Code Quality

- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety (optional)
- **Consistent import organization**

## 🚀 Deployment

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## 📝 Contributing

1. Follow the established code style (Prettier configuration)
2. Write tests for new features
3. Run linting before committing
4. Use meaningful commit messages

## 🔄 Migration Notes

If upgrading from the previous version:

1. **CSS imports**: Update imports from `./index.css` to `./styles/main.css`
2. **Test utilities**: Remove references to `testHelpers.js`
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to get the updated dependencies
4. **Build process**: The new build configuration may require cache clearing
